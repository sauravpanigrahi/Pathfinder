    "question": "Explain event delegation",
    "answer": "Event delegation is a technique involving adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM. The benefits of this technique are:\n\n- Memory footprint goes down because only one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to attach event handlers on each descendant.\n- There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new elements.",

    "question": "Explain how `this` works in JavaScript",
    "answer": "There's no simple explanation for `this`; it is one of the most confusing concepts in JavaScript. A hand-wavey explanation is that the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. I have read many explanations on `this` online, and I found [Arnav Aggrawal](https://medium.com/@arnav_aggarwal)'s explanation to be the clearest. The following rules are applied:\n\n1. If the `new` keyword is used when calling the function, `this` inside the function is a brand new object.\n2. If `apply`, `call`, or `bind` are used to call/create a function, `this` inside the function is the object that is passed in as the argument.\n3. If a function is called as a method, such as `obj.method()` — `this` is the object that the function is a property of.\n4. If a function is invoked as a free function invocation, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, `this` is the global object. In a browser, it is the `window` object. If in strict mode (`'use strict'`), `this` will be `undefined` instead of the global object.\n5. If multiple of the above rules apply, the rule that is higher wins and will set the `this` value.\n6. If the function is an ES2015 arrow function, it ignores all the rules above and receives the `this` value of its surrounding scope at the time it is created.",

    "question": "Explain how prototypal inheritance works",
    "answer": "All JavaScript objects have a `__proto__` property with the exception of objects created with `Object.create(null)`, that is a reference to another object, which is called the object's \"prototype\". When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object's `__proto__`, and the `__proto__`'s `__proto__` and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the `__proto__`s or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain. This behavior simulates classical inheritance, but it is really more of [delegation than inheritance](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-objects).\n\n#### Example of Prototypal Inheritance\n\n```js\n// Parent object constructor.\nfunction Animal(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\n// Add a method to the parent object's prototype.\nAnimal.prototype.makeSound = function () {\n  console.log('The ' + this.constructor.name + ' makes a sound.');\n};\n\n// Child object constructor.\nfunction Dog(name) {\n  Animal.call(this, name); // Call the parent constructor.\n}\n\n// Set the child object's prototype to be the parent's prototype.\nObject.setPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype, Animal.prototype);\n\n// Add a method to the child object's prototype.\nDog.prototype.bark = function () {\n  console.log('Woof!');\n};\n\n// Create a new instance of Dog.\nconst bolt = new Dog('Bolt');\n\n// Call methods on the child object.\nconsole.log(bolt.name); // \"Bolt\"\nbolt.makeSound(); // \"The Dog makes a sound.\"\nbolt.bark(); // \"Woof!\"\n```\n\nThings to note are:\n\n- `.makeSound` is not defined on `Dog`, so the engine goes up the prototype chain and finds `.makeSound` off the inherited `Animal`.\n- Using `Object.create` to build the inheritance chain is no longer recommended. Use `Object.setPrototypeOf` instead.",

    "question": "What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?",
    "answer": "Both are ways to implement a module system, which was not natively present in JavaScript until ES2015 came along. CommonJS is synchronous while AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is obviously asynchronous. CommonJS is designed with server-side development in mind while AMD, with its support for asynchronous loading of modules, is more intended for browsers.\n\nI find AMD syntax to be quite verbose and CommonJS is closer to the style you would write import statements in other languages. Most of the time, I find AMD unnecessary, because if you served all your JavaScript into one concatenated bundle file, you wouldn't benefit from the async loading properties. Also, CommonJS syntax is closer to Node style of writing modules and there is less context-switching overhead when switching between client side and server side JavaScript development.\n\nI'm glad that with ES2015 modules, that has support for both synchronous and asynchronous loading, we can finally just stick to one approach. Although it hasn't been fully rolled out in browsers and in Node, we can always use transpilers to convert our code.",

    "question": "Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`. What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?",
    "answer": "IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. The JavaScript parser reads `function foo(){ }();` as `function foo(){ }` and `();`, where the former is a _function declaration_ and the latter (a pair of parentheses) is an attempt at calling a function but there is no name specified, hence it throws `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token )`.\n\nHere are two ways to fix it that involves adding more parentheses: `(function foo(){ })()` and `(function foo(){ }())`. Statements that begin with `function` are considered to be _function declarations_; by wrapping this function within `()`, it becomes a _function expression_ which can then be executed with the subsequent `()`. These functions are not exposed in the global scope and you can even omit its name if you do not need to reference itself within the body.\n\nYou might also use `void` operator: `void function foo(){ }();`. Unfortunately, there is one issue with such approach. The evaluation of given expression is always `undefined`, so if your IIFE function returns anything, you can't use it. An example:\n\n```js\nconst foo = void (function bar() {\n  return 'foo';\n})();\n\nconsole.log(foo); // undefined\n",

    "question": "What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or undeclared? How would you go about checking for any of these states?",
    "answer": "**Undeclared** variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using `var`, `let` or `const`. Undeclared variables will be defined globally, outside of the current scope. In strict mode, a `ReferenceError` will be thrown when you try to assign to an undeclared variable. Undeclared variables are bad just like how global variables are bad. Avoid them at all cost! To check for them, wrap its usage in a `try`/`catch` block.\n\n```js\nfunction foo() {\n  x = 1; // Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode\n}\n\nfoo();\nconsole.log(x); // 1\n```\n\nA variable that is `undefined` is a variable that has been declared, but not assigned a value. It is of type `undefined`. If a function does not return any value as the result of executing it is assigned to a variable, the variable also has the value of `undefined`. To check for it, compare using the strict equality (`===`) operator or `typeof` which will give the `'undefined'` string. Note that you should not be using the abstract equality operator to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `null`.\n\n```js\nvar foo;\nconsole.log(foo); // undefined\nconsole.log(foo === undefined); // true\nconsole.log(typeof foo === 'undefined'); // true\n\nconsole.log(foo == null); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!\n\nfunction bar() {}\nvar baz = bar();\nconsole.log(baz); // undefined\n```\n\nA variable that is `null` will have been explicitly assigned to the `null` value. It represents no value and is different from `undefined` in the sense that it has been explicitly assigned. To check for `null,` simply compare using the strict equality operator. Note that like the above, you should not be using the abstract equality operator (`==`) to check, as it will also return `true` if the value is `undefined`.\n\n```js\nvar foo = null;\nconsole.log(foo === null); // true\nconsole.log(typeof foo === 'object'); // true\n\nconsole.log(foo == undefined); // true. Wrong, don't use this to check!\n```\n\nAs a personal habit, I never leave my variables undeclared or unassigned. I will explicitly assign `null` to them after declaring if I don't intend to use it yet. If you use a linter in your workflow, it will usually also be able to check that you are not referencing undeclared variables.",

    "answer": "To understand the differences between the two, let's look at what each function does.\n\n**`forEach`**\n\n- Iterates through the elements in an array.\n- Executes a callback for each element.\n- Does not return a value.\n\n```js\nconst a = [1, 2, 3];\nconst doubled = a.forEach((num, index) => {\n  // Do something with num and/or index.\n});\n\n// doubled = undefined\n```\n\n**`map`**\n\n- Iterates through the elements in an array.\n- \"Maps\" each element to a new element by calling the function on each element, creating a new array as a result.\n\n```js\nconst a = [1, 2, 3];\nconst doubled = a.map((num) => {\n  return num * 2;\n});\n\n// doubled = [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\nThe main difference between `.forEach` and `.map()` is that `.map()` returns a new array. If you need the result, but do not wish to mutate the original array, `.map()` is the clear choice. If you simply need to iterate over an array, `forEach` is a fine choice.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://codeburst.io/javascript-map-vs-foreach-f38111822c0f?gi=c9bc30cbec28",

    "answer": "This question is pretty vague. My best guess at its intention is that it is asking about constructors in JavaScript. Technically speaking, `function Person(){}` is just a normal function declaration. The convention is to use PascalCase for functions that are intended to be used as constructors.\n\n`var person = Person()` invokes the `Person` as a function, and not as a constructor. Invoking as such is a common mistake if the function is intended to be used as a constructor. Typically, the constructor does not return anything, hence invoking the constructor like a normal function will return `undefined` and that gets assigned to the variable intended as the instance.\n\n`var person = new Person()` creates an instance of the `Person` object using the `new` operator, which inherits from `Person.prototype`. An alternative would be to use `Object.create`, such as: `Object.create(Person.prototype)`.\n\n```js\nfunction Person(name) {\n  this.name = name;\n}\n\nvar person = Person('John');\nconsole.log(person); // undefined\nconsole.log(person.name); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined\n\nvar person = new Person('John');\nconsole.log(person); // Person { name: \"John\" }\nconsole.log(person.name); // \"john\"\n```\n",

For example:\n\n```js\nif ('geolocation' in navigator) {\n  // Can use navigator.geolocation\n} else {\n  // Handle lack of feature\n}\n```\n\n[Modernizr](https://modernizr.com/) is a great library to handle feature detection.\n\n**Feature Inference**\n\nFeature inference checks for a feature just like feature detection, but uses another function because it assumes it will also exist, e.g.:\n\n```js\nif (document.getElementsByTagName) {\n  element = document.getElementById(id);\n}\n```\n\nThis is not really recommended. Feature detection is more foolproof.\n\n**UA String**\n\nThis is a browser-reported string that allows the network protocol peers to identify the application type, operating system, software vendor or software version of the requesting software user agent.

    "answer": "JSONP (JSON with Padding) is a method commonly used to bypass the cross-domain policies in web browsers because Ajax requests from the current page to a cross-origin domain is not allowed.\n\nJSONP works by making a request to a cross-origin domain via a `<script>` tag and usually with a `callback` query parameter, for example: `https://example.com?callback=printData`. The server will then wrap the data within a function called `printData` and return it to the client.\n\n```html\n<!-- https://mydomain.com -->\n<script>\n  function printData(data) {\n    console.log(`My name is ${data.name}!`);\n  }\n</script>\n\n<script src=\"https://example.com?callback=printData\"></script>\n```\n\n```js\n// File loaded from https://example.com?callback=printData\nprintData({ name: 'Yang Shun' });\n```\n\nThe client has to have the `printData` function in its global scope and the function will be executed by the client when the response from the cross-origin domain is received.\n\nJSONP can be unsafe and has some security implications. As JSONP is really JavaScript, it can do everything else JavaScript can do, so you need to trust the provider of the JSONP data.\n\nThese days, [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) is the recommended approach and JSONP is seen as a hack.",

    "answer": "Hoisting is a term used to explain the behavior of variable declarations in your code. Variables declared or initialized with the `var` keyword will have their declaration \"moved\" up to the top of their module/function-level scope, which we refer to as hoisting. However, only the declaration is hoisted, the assignment (if there is one), will stay where it is.\n\nNote that the declaration is not actually moved - the JavaScript engine parses the declarations during compilation and becomes aware of declarations and their scopes. It is just easier to understand this behavior by visualizing the declarations as being hoisted to the top of their scope. Let's explain with a few examples.\n\n```js\nconsole.log(foo); // undefined\nvar foo = 1;\nconsole.log(foo); // 1\n```\n\nFunction declarations have the body hoisted while the function expressions (written in the form of variable declarations) only has the variable declaration hoisted.\n\n```js\n// Function Declaration\nconsole.log(foo); // [Function: foo]\nfoo(); // 'FOOOOO'\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log('FOOOOO');\n}\nconsole.log(foo); // [Function: foo]\n\n// Function Expression\nconsole.log(bar); // undefined\nbar(); // Uncaught TypeError: bar is not a function\nvar bar = function () {\n  console.log('BARRRR');\n};\nconsole.log(bar); // [Function: bar]\n```\n\nVariables declared via `let` and `const` are hoisted as well. However, unlike `var` and `function`, they are not initialized and accessing them before the declaration will result in a `ReferenceError` exception. The variable is in a \"temporal dead zone\" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.\n\n```js\nx; // undefined\ny; // Reference error: y is not defined\n\nvar x = 'local';\nlet y = 'local';\n```\n",

    "answer": "The below is taken from the awesome [Grab Front End Guide](https://github.com/grab/front-end-guide), which coincidentally, is written by me!\n\nWeb developers these days refer to the products they build as web apps, rather than websites. While there is no strict difference between the two terms, web apps tend to be highly interactive and dynamic, allowing the user to perform actions and receive a response to their action. Traditionally, the browser receives HTML from the server and renders it. When the user navigates to another URL, a full-page refresh is required and the server sends fresh new HTML to the new page. This is called server-side rendering.\n\nHowever, in modern SPAs, client-side rendering is used instead. The browser loads the initial page from the server, along with the scripts (frameworks, libraries, app code) and stylesheets required for the whole app. When the user navigates to other pages, a page refresh is not triggered. The URL of the page is updated via the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API). New data required for the new page, usually in JSON format, is retrieved by the browser via [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests) requests to the server. The SPA then dynamically updates the page with the data via JavaScript, which it has already downloaded in the initial page load. This model is similar to how native mobile apps work.\n\nThe benefits:\n\n- The app feels more responsive and users do not see the flash between page navigations due to full-page refreshes.\n- Fewer HTTP requests are made to the server, as the same assets do not have to be downloaded again for each page load.\n- Clear separation of the concerns between the client and the server; you can easily build new clients for different platforms (e.g. mobile, chatbots, smart watches) without having to modify the server code. You can also modify the technology stack on the client and server independently, as long as the API contract is not broken.\n\nThe downsides:\n\n- Heavier initial page load due to the loading of framework, app code, and assets required for multiple pages.\n- There's an additional step to be done on your server which is to configure it to route all requests to a single entry point and allow client-side routing to take over from there.\n- SPAs are reliant on JavaScript to render content, but not all search engines execute JavaScript during crawling, and they may see empty content on your page. This inadvertently hurts the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of your app. However, most of the time, when you are building apps, SEO is not the most important factor, as not all the content needs to be indexable by search engines. To overcome this, you can either server-side render your app or use services such as [Prerender](https://prerender.io/) to \"render your javascript in a browser, save the static HTML, and return that to the crawlers\".",

    "question": "What language constructions do you use for iterating over object properties and array items?",
    "answer": "For objects:\n\n- `for-in` loops - `for (var property in obj) { console.log(property); }`. However, this will also iterate through its inherited properties, and you will add an `obj.hasOwnProperty(property)` check before using it.\n- `Object.keys()` - `Object.keys(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.keys()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\n- `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` - `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach(function (property) { ... })`. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` is a static method that will lists all enumerable and non-enumerable properties of the object that you pass it.\n\nFor arrays:\n\n- `for` loops - `for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`. The common pitfall here is that `var` is in the function scope and not the block scope and most of the time you would want block scoped iterator variable. ES2015 introduces `let` which has block scope and it is recommended to use that instead. So this becomes: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)`.\n- `forEach` - `arr.forEach(function (el, index) { ... })`. This construct can be more convenient at times because you do not have to use the `index` if all you need is the array elements. There are also the `every` and `some` methods which will allow you to terminate the iteration early.\n- `for-of` loops - `for (let elem of arr) { ... }`. ES6 introduces a new loop, the `for-of` loop, that allows you to loop over objects that conform to the [iterable protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#The_iterable_protocol) such as `String`, `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, etc. It combines the advantages of the `for` loop and the `forEach()` method. The advantage of the `for` loop is that you can break from it, and the advantage of `forEach()` is that it is more concise than the `for` loop because you don't need a counter variable. With the `for-of` loop, you get both the ability to break from a loop and a more concise syntax.\n\nMost of the time, I would prefer the `.forEach` method, but it really depends on what you are trying to do. Before ES6, we used `for` loops when we needed to prematurely terminate the loop using `break`. But now with ES6, we can do that with `for-of` loops. I would use `for` loops when I need even more flexibility, such as incrementing the iterator more than once per loop.\n\nAlso, when using the `for-of` loop, if you need to access both the index and value of each array element, you can do so with the ES6 Array `entries()` method and destructuring:\n\n```js\nconst arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];\n\nfor (let [index, elem] of arr.entries()) {\n  console.log(index, ': ', elem);\n}",

    "question": "Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects.",
    "answer": "Immutability is a core principle in functional programming, and has lots to offer to object-oriented programs as well. A mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.\n\n#### What is an example of an immutable object in JavaScript?\n\nIn JavaScript, some built-in types (numbers, strings) are immutable, but custom objects are generally mutable.\n\nSome built-in immutable JavaScript objects are `Math`, `Date`.\n\nHere are a few ways to add/simulate immutability on plain JavaScript objects.\n\n**Object Constant Properties**\n\nBy combining `writable: false` and `configurable: false`, you can essentially create a constant (cannot be changed, redefined or deleted) as an object property, like:\n\n```js\nlet myObject = {};\nObject.defineProperty(myObject, 'number', {\n  value: 42,\n  writable: false,\n  configurable: false,\n});\nconsole.log(myObject.number); // 42\nmyObject.number = 43;\nconsole.log(myObject.number); // 42\n```\n\n**Prevent Extensions**\n\nIf you want to prevent an object from having new properties added to it, but otherwise leave the rest of the object's properties alone, call `Object.preventExtensions(...)`:\n\n```js\nvar myObject = {\n  a: 2,\n};\n\nObject.preventExtensions(myObject);\n\nmyObject.b = 3;\nmyObject.b; // undefined\n```\n\nIn non-strict mode, the creation of `b` fails silently. In strict mode, it throws a `TypeError`.\n\n**Seal**\n\n`Object.seal()` creates a \"sealed\" object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.preventExtensions()` on it, but also marks all its existing properties as `configurable: false`.\n\nSo, not only can you not add any more properties, but you also cannot reconfigure or delete any existing properties (though you can still modify their values).\n\n**Freeze**\n\n`Object.freeze()` creates a frozen object, which means it takes an existing object and essentially calls `Object.seal()` on it, but it also marks all \"data accessor\" properties as writable:false, so that their values cannot be changed.\n\nThis approach is the highest level of immutability that you can attain for an object itself, as it prevents any changes to the object or to any of its direct properties (though, as mentioned above, the contents of any referenced other objects are unaffected).\n\n```js\nvar immutable = Object.freeze({});\n```\n\nFreezing an object does not allow new properties to be added to an object and prevents from removing or altering the existing properties. `Object.freeze()` preserves the enumerability, configurability, writability and the prototype of the object. It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.\n\n#### What are the pros and cons of immutability?\n\n**Pros**\n\n- Easier change detection - Object equality can be determined in a performant and easy manner through referential equality. This is useful for comparing object differences in React and Redux.\n- Programs with immutable objects are less complicated to think about, since you don't need to worry about how an object may evolve over time.\n- Defensive copies are no longer necessary when immutable objects are returning from or passed to functions, since there is no possibility an immutable object will be modified by it.\n- Easy sharing via references - One copy of an object is just as good as another, so you can cache objects or reuse the same object multiple times.\n- Thread-safe - Immutable objects can be safely used between threads in a multi-threaded environment since there is no risk of them being modified in other concurrently running threads.\n- Using libraries like ImmutableJS, objects are modified using structural sharing and less memory is needed for having multiple objects with similar structures.\n\n**Cons**\n\n- Naive implementations of immutable data structures and its operations can result in extremely poor performance because new objects are created each time. It is recommended to use libraries for efficient immutable data structures and operations that leverage on structural sharing.\n- Allocation (and deallocation) of many small objects rather than modifying existing ones can cause a performance impact. The complexity of either the allocator or the garbage collector usually depends on the number of objects on the heap.\n- Cyclic data structures such as graphs are difficult to build. If you have two objects which can't be modified after initialization, how can you get them to point to each other?",

    "answer": "The main advantage of using an arrow function as a method inside a constructor is that the value of `this` gets set at the time of the function creation and can't change after that. So, when the constructor is used to create a new object, `this` will always refer to that object. For example, let's say we have a `Person` constructor that takes a first name as an argument has two methods to `console.log` that name, one as a regular function and one as an arrow function:\n\n```js\nconst Person = function (firstName) {\n  this.firstName = firstName;\n  this.sayName1 = function () {\n    console.log(this.firstName);\n  };\n  this.sayName2 = () => {\n    console.log(this.firstName);\n  };\n};\n\nconst john = new Person('John');\nconst dave = new Person('Dave');\n\njohn.sayName1(); // John\njohn.sayName2(); // John\n\n// The regular function can have its 'this' value changed, but the arrow function cannot\njohn.sayName1.call(dave); // Dave (because \"this\" is now the dave object)\njohn.sayName2.call(dave); // John\n\njohn.sayName1.apply(dave); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)\njohn.sayName2.apply(dave); // John\n\njohn.sayName1.bind(dave)(); // Dave (because 'this' is now the dave object)\njohn.sayName2.bind(dave)(); // John\n\nvar sayNameFromWindow1 = john.sayName1;\nsayNameFromWindow1(); // undefined (because 'this' is now the window object)\n\nvar sayNameFromWindow2 = john.sayName2;\nsayNameFromWindow2(); // John\n```\n\nThe main takeaway here is that `this` can be changed for a normal function, but the context always stays the same for an arrow function. So even if you are passing around your arrow function to different parts of your application, you wouldn't have to worry about the context changing.\n\nThis can be particularly helpful in React class components. If you define a class method for something such as a click handler using a normal function, and then you pass that click handler down into a child component as a prop, you will need to also bind `this` in the constructor of the parent component. If you instead use an arrow function, there is no need to also bind \"this\", as the method will automatically get its \"this\" value from its enclosing lexical context.

Other popular examples in JavaScript are `forEach`, `filter`, and `reduce`. A higher-order function doesn't just need to be manipulating arrays as there are many use cases for returning a function from another function. `Function.prototype.bind` is one such example in JavaScript.\n\n**Map**\n\nLet say we have an array of names which we need to transform each string to uppercase.\n\n```js\nconst names = ['irish', 'daisy', 'anna'];\n```\n\nThe imperative way will be as such:\n\n```js\nconst transformNamesToUppercase = function (names) {\n  const results = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {\n    results.push(names[i].toUpperCase());\n  }\n  return results;\n};\ntransformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']\n```\n\nUse `.map(transformerFn)` makes the code shorter and more declarative.\n\n```js\nconst transformNamesToUppercase = function (names) {\n  return names.map((name) => name.toUpperCase());\n};\ntransformNamesToUppercase(names); // ['IRISH', 'DAISY', 'ANNA']",

    "question": "ES6 Template Literals offer a lot of flexibility in generating strings, can you give an example?",
    "answer": "Template literals help make it simple to do string interpolation, or to include variables in a string. Before ES2015, it was common to do something like this:\n\n```js\nvar person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };\nconsole.log(\n  'Hi, my name is ' + person.name + ' and I am ' + person.age + ' years old!',\n);\n// 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'\n```\n\nWith template literals, you can now create that same output like this instead:\n\n```js\nconst person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };\nconsole.log(`Hi, my name is ${person.name} and I am ${person.age} years old!`);\n// 'Hi, my name is Tyler and I am 28 years old!'\n```\n\nNote that you use backticks, not quotes, to indicate that you are using a template literal and that you can insert expressions inside the `${}` placeholders.\n\nA second helpful use case is in creating multi-line strings. Before ES2015, you could create a multi-line string like this:\n\n```js\nconsole.log('This is line one.\\nThis is line two.');\n// This is line one.\n// This is line two.\n```\n\nOr if you wanted to break it up into multiple lines in your code so you didn't have to scroll to the right in your text editor to read a long string, you could also write it like this:\n\n```js\nconsole.log('This is line one.\\n' + 'This is line two.');\n// This is line one.\n// This is line two.\n```\n\nTemplate literals, however, preserve whatever spacing you add to them. For example, to create that same multi-line output that we created above, you can simply do:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(`This is line one.\nThis is line two.`);\n// This is line one.\n// This is line two.\n```\n\nAnother use case of template literals would be to use as a substitute for templating libraries for simple variable interpolations:\n\n```js\nconst person = { name: 'Tyler', age: 28 };\ndocument.body.innerHTML = `\n  <div>\n    <p>Name: ${person.name}</p>\n    <p>Age: ${person.age}</p>\n  </div>\n`;\n```\n\n**Note that your code may be susceptible to XSS by using `.innerHTML`.

    "answer": "Currying is a pattern where a function with more than one parameter is broken into multiple functions that, when called in series, will accumulate all of the required parameters one at a time. This technique can be useful for making code written in a functional style easier to read and compose. It's important to note that for a function to be curried, it needs to start out as one function, then broken out into a sequence of functions that each accepts one parameter.\n\n```js\nfunction curry(fn) {\n  if (fn.length === 0) {\n    return fn;\n  }\n\n  function _curried(depth, args) {\n    return function (newArgument) {\n      if (depth - 1 === 0) {\n        return fn(...args, newArgument);\n      }\n      return _curried(depth - 1, [...args, newArgument]);\n    };\n  }\n\n  return _curried(fn.length, []);\n}\n\nfunction add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nvar curriedAdd = curry(add);\nvar addFive = curriedAdd(5);\n\nvar result = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(addFive); // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]",

    "question": "What are the benefits of using spread syntax and how is it different from rest syntax?",
    "answer": "ES6's spread syntax is very useful when coding in a functional paradigm as we can easily create copies of arrays or objects without resorting to `Object.create`, `slice`, or a library function. This language feature is used often in Redux and RxJS projects.\n\n```js\nfunction putDookieInAnyArray(arr) {\n  return [...arr, 'dookie'];\n}\n\nconst result = putDookieInAnyArray(['I', 'really', \"don't\", 'like']); // [\"I\", \"really\", \"don't\", \"like\", \"dookie\"]\n\nconst person = {\n  name: 'Todd',\n  age: 29,\n};\n\nconst copyOfTodd = { ...person };\n```\n\nES6's rest syntax offers a shorthand for including an arbitrary number of arguments to be passed to a function. It is like an inverse of the spread syntax, taking data and stuffing it into an array rather than unpacking an array of data, and it works in function arguments, as well as in array and object destructuring assignments.\n\n```js\nfunction addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(...numbers) {\n  return numbers.map((x) => x + 5);\n}\n\nconst result = addFiveToABunchOfNumbers(4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10); // [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]\n\nconst [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // a: 1, b: 2, rest: [3, 4]\n\nconst { e, f, ...others } = {\n  e: 1,\n  f: 2,\n  g: 3,\n  h: 4,\n}; // e: 1, f: 2, others: { g: 3, h: 4 }",

It is used to tell user agents what version of the HTML specifications your document respects. Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the **no-quirks mode** matching this DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the **quirks mode**.\n\nThe DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML5 standards is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype\n- https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/xhtml.html\n- https://quirks.spec.whatwg.org/",

    "answer": "I will assume that it is asking about the most common case, which is how to serve a page with content available in multiple languages, but the content within the page should be displayed only in one consistent language.\n\nWhen an HTTP request is made to a server, the requesting user agent usually sends information about language preferences, such as in the `Accept-Language` header. The server can then use this information to return a version of the document in the appropriate language if such an alternative is available. The returned HTML document should also declare the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag, such as `<html lang=\"en\">...</html>`.\n\nOf course this is useless for letting a search engine know that the same content is available in different languages, and so you must also make use of the `hreflang` attribute in the `<head>`. Eg. `<link rel=\"alternate\" hreflang=\"de\" href=\"http://de.example.com/page.html\" />`\n\nIn the back end, the HTML markup will contain `i18n` placeholders and content for the specific language stored in YML or JSON formats.

    "question": "What kind of things must you be wary of when designing or developing for multilingual sites?",
    "answer": "- Use `lang` attribute in your HTML.\n- Directing users to their native language - Allow a user to change his country/language easily without hassle.\n- Text in raster-based images (e.g. png, gif, jpg, etc.), is not a scalable approach - Placing text in an image is still a popular way to get good-looking, non-system fonts to display on any computer. However, to translate image text, each string of text will need to have a separate image created for each language. Anything more than a handful of replacements like this can quickly get out of control.\n- Restrictive words/sentence length - Some content can be longer when written in another language. Be wary of layout or overflow issues in the design. It's best to avoid designing where the amount of text would make or break a design. Character counts come into play with things like headlines, labels, and buttons. They are less of an issue with free-flowing text such as body text or comments.\n- Be mindful of how colors are perceived - Colors are perceived differently across languages and cultures. The design should use color appropriately.\n- Formatting dates and currencies - Calendar dates are sometimes presented in different ways. Eg. \"May 31, 2012\" in the U.S. vs. \"31 May 2012\" in parts of Europe.\n- Do not concatenate translated strings - Do not do anything like `\"The date today is \" + date`. It will break in languages with different word order. Use a template string with parameters substitution for each language instead. For example, look at the following two sentences in English and Chinese respectively: `I will travel on {% date %}` and `{% date %} 我会出发`. Note that the position of the variable is different due to grammar rules of the language.\n- Language reading direction - In English, we read from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, in traditional Japanese, text is read up-to-down, right-to-left.\n- Useful-to-have - include the locale in the path (e.g en_US, zh_CN, etc).",

    "question": "What are `data-` attributes good for?",
    "answer": "Before JavaScript frameworks became popular, front end developers used `data-` attributes to store extra data within the DOM itself, without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on the DOM. It is intended to store custom data private to the page or application, for which there are no more appropriate attributes or elements.\n\nThese days, using `data-` attributes is generally not encouraged. One reason is that users can modify the data attribute easily by using inspect element in the browser. The data model is better stored within JavaScript itself and stay updated with the DOM via data binding possibly through a library or a framework.\n\nHowever, one perfectly valid use of data attributes, is to add a hook for _end to end_ testing frameworks such as Selenium and Capybara without having to create a meaningless classes or ID attributes.

    "question": "Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head></head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?",
    "answer": "**Placing `<link>`s in the `<head>`**\n\nPutting `<link>`s in the `<head>` is part of proper specification in building an optimized website. When a page first loads, HTML and CSS are being parsed simultaneously; HTML creates the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS creates the CSSOM (CSS Object Model). Both are needed to create the visuals in a website, allowing for a quick \"first meaningful paint\" timing. This progressive rendering is a category optimization sites are measured in their performance scores. Putting stylesheets near the bottom of the document is what prohibits progressive rendering in many browsers. Some browsers block rendering to avoid having to repaint elements of the page if their styles change. The user is then stuck viewing a blank white page. Other times there can be flashes of unstyled content (FOUC), which show a webpage with no styling applied.\n\n**Placing `<script>`s just before `</body>`**\n\n`<script>` tags block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and executed which can slow down your page. Placing the scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first.\n\nAn exception for positioning of `<script>`s at the bottom is when your script contains `document.write()`, but these days it's not a good practice to use `document.write()`. Also, placing `<script>`s at the bottom means that the browser cannot start downloading the scripts until the entire document is parsed. This ensures your code that needs to manipulate DOM elements will not throw an error and halt the entire script. If you need to put `<script>`s in the `<head>`, use the `defer` attribute, which will achieve the same effect of running the script only after the HTML is parsed but the browser can download the script earlier.\n\nKeep in mind that putting scripts just before the closing `</body>` tag will create the illusion that the page loads faster on an empty cache (since the scripts won't block downloading the rest of the document). However, if you have some code you want to run during page load, it will only start executing after the entire page has loaded. If you put those scripts in the `<head>` tag, they would start executing before - so on a primed cache the page would actually appear to load faster.\n\n**`<head>` and `<body>` tags are now optional**\n\nAs per the HTML5 specification, certain HTML tags like `<head>` and `<body>` are optional. Google's style guide even recommends removing them to save bytes. However, this practice is still not widely adopted and the performance gain is likely to be minimal and for most sites it's not likely going to matter.",

    "answer": "You would use the `srcset` attribute when you want to serve different images to users depending on their device display width - serve higher quality images to devices with retina display enhances the user experience while serving lower resolution images to low-end devices increase performance and decrease data wastage (because serving a larger image will not have any visible difference). For example: `<img srcset=\"small.jpg 500w, medium.jpg 1000w, large.jpg 2000w\" src=\"...\" alt=\"\">` tells the browser to display the small, medium or large `.jpg` graphic depending on the client's resolution. The first value is the image name and the second is the width of the image in pixels. For a device width of 320px, the following calculations are made:\n\n- 500 / 320 = 1.5625\n- 1000 / 320 = 3.125\n- 2000 / 320 = 6.25\n\nIf the client's resolution is 1x, 1.5625 is the closest, and `500w` corresponding to `small.jpg` will be selected by the browser.\n\nIf the resolution is retina (2x), the browser will use the closest resolution above the minimum. Meaning it will not choose the 500w (1.5625) because it is greater than 1 and the image might look bad. The browser would then choose the image with a resulting ratio closer to 2 which is 1000w (3.125).\n\n`srcset`s solve the problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and also optionally that you want to serve different resolution images to high density/low-density screens.",

    "answer": "The browser determines what styles to show on an element depending on the specificity of CSS rules. We assume that the browser has already determined the rules that match a particular element. Among the matching rules, the specificity, four comma-separate values, `a, b, c, d` are calculated for each rule based on the following:\n\n1. `a` is whether inline styles are being used. If the property declaration is an inline style on the element, `a` is 1, else 0.\n2. `b` is the number of ID selectors.\n3. `c` is the number of classes, attributes and pseudo-classes selectors.\n4. `d` is the number of tags and pseudo-elements selectors.\n\nThe resulting specificity is not a score, but a matrix of values that can be compared column by column. When comparing selectors to determine which has the highest specificity, look from left to right, and compare the highest value in each column. So a value in column `b` will override values in columns `c` and `d`, no matter what they might be. As such, specificity of `0,1,0,0` would be greater than one of `0,0,10,10`.\n\nIn the cases of equal specificity: the latest rule is the one that counts. If you have written the same rule into your stylesheet (regardless of internal or external) twice, then the lower rule in your style sheet is closer to the element to be styled, it is deemed to be more specific and therefore will be applied.\n\nI would write CSS rules with low specificity so that they can be easily overridden if necessary. When writing CSS UI component library code, it is important that they have low specificities so that users of the library can override them without using too complicated CSS rules just for the sake of increasing specificity or resorting to `!important`.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/\n- https://www.sitepoint.com/css-selectors-specificity/",

Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the page, and will affect the positioning of other elements (e.g. text will flow around floated elements), unlike `position: absolute` elements, which are removed from the flow of the page.\n\nThe CSS `clear` property can be used to be positioned below `left`/`right`/`both` floated elements.\n\nIf a parent element contains nothing but floated elements, its height will be collapsed to nothing. It can be fixed by clearing the float after the floated elements in the container but before the close of the container.\n\nThe `.clearfix` hack uses a clever CSS [pseudo selector](#describe-pseudo-elements-and-discuss-what-they-are-used-for) (`::after`) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class `clearfix` to it. Then apply this CSS:\n\n```css\n.clearfix::after {\n  content: ' ';\n  visibility: hidden;\n  display: block;\n  height: 0;\n  clear: both;\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, give `overflow: auto` or `overflow: hidden` property to the parent element which will establish a new block formatting context inside the children and it will expand to contain its children.",

    "question": "Describe `z-index` and how stacking context is formed.",
    "answer": "The `z-index` property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. `z-index` only affects elements that have a `position` value which is not `static`.\n\nWithout any `z-index` value, elements stack in the order that they appear in the DOM (the lowest one down at the same hierarchy level appears on top). Elements with non-static positioning (and their children) will always appear on top of elements with default static positioning, regardless of HTML hierarchy.\n\nA stacking context is an element that contains a set of layers. Within a local stacking context, the `z-index` values of its children are set relative to that element rather than to the document root. Layers outside of that context — i.e. sibling elements of a local stacking context — can't sit between layers within it. If an element B sits on top of element A, a child element of element A, element C, can never be higher than element B even if element C has a higher `z-index` than element B.\n\nEach stacking context is self-contained - after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context. A handful of CSS properties trigger a new stacking context, such as `opacity` less than 1, `filter` that is not `none`, and `transform` that is not`none`.\n\n_Note: What exactly qualifies an element to create a stacking context is listed in this long set of [rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Stacking_context#The_stacking_context).",

    "question": "Describe Block Formatting Context (BFC) and how it works.",
    "answer": "A Block Formatting Context (BFC) is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out. Floats, absolutely positioned elements, `inline-blocks`, `table-cells`, `table-caption`s, and elements with `overflow` other than `visible` (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts.\n\nKnowing how to establish a block formatting context is important, because without doing so, the containing box will not [contain floated children](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context#Make_float_content_and_alongside_content_the_same_height). This is similar to collapsing margins, but more insidious as you will find entire boxes collapsing in odd ways.\n\nA BFC is an HTML box that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:\n\n- The value of `float` is not `none`.\n- The value of `position` is neither `static` nor `relative`.\n- The value of `display` is `table-cell`, `table-caption`, `inline-block`, `flex`, or `inline-flex`, `grid`, or `inline-grid`.\n- The value of `overflow` is not `visible`.\n\nIn a BFC, each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch).\n\nVertical margins between adjacent block-level boxes in a BFC collapse.

Most SVG you'll find around the web use inline CSS, but there are advantages and disadvantages associated with each type.\n\nBasic coloring can be done by setting two attributes on the node: `fill` and `stroke`. `fill` sets the color inside the object and `stroke` sets the color of the line drawn around the object. You can use the same CSS color naming schemes that you use in HTML, whether that's color names (that is `red`), RGB values (that is `rgb(255,0,0)`), Hex values, RGBA values, etc.\n\n```html\n<rect\n  x=\"10\"\n  y=\"10\"\n  width=\"100\"\n  height=\"100\"\n  stroke=\"blue\"\n  fill=\"purple\"\n  fill-opacity=\"0.5\"\n  stroke-opacity=\"0.8\" />\n```\n\nThe above `fill=\"purple\"` is an example of a _presentational attribute_. Interestingly, and unlike inline styles like `style=\"fill: purple\"` which also happens to be an attribute, presentational attributes can be [overriden by CSS](https://css-tricks.com/presentation-attributes-vs-inline-styles/) styles defined in a stylesheet.

    "answer": "Note that these two 2 approaches are not exclusive.\n\nMaking a website responsive means that some elements will respond by adapting its size or other functionality according to the device's screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries, for example, making the font size smaller on smaller devices.\n\n```css\n@media (min-width: 601px) {\n  .my-class {\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 600px) {\n  .my-class {\n    font-size: 12px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA mobile-first strategy is also responsive, however it agrees we should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only add specific responsive rules to other devices later. Following the previous example:\n\n```css\n.my-class {\n  font-size: 12px;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 600px) {\n  .my-class {\n    font-size: 24px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA mobile-first strategy has 2 main advantages:\n\n- It's more performant on mobile devices, since all the rules applied for them don't have to be validated against any media queries.\n- It forces to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.",

Responsive websites use media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images to create a user experience that flexes and changes based on a multitude of factors. Like a single ball growing or shrinking to fit through several different hoops.\n\nAdaptive design is more like the modern definition of progressive enhancement. Instead of one flexible design, adaptive design detects the device and other features and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics. The site detects the type of device used and delivers the pre-set layout for that device. Instead of a single ball going through several different-sized hoops, you'd have several different balls to use depending on the hoop size.\n\nBoth have these methods have some issues that need to be weighed:\n\n- Responsive design can be quite challenging, as you're essentially using a single albeit responsive layout to fit all situations. How to set the media query breakpoints is one such challenge. Do you use standardized breakpoint values? Or, do you use breakpoints that make sense to your particular layout? What if that layout changes?\n- Adaptive design generally requires user agent sniffing, or DPI detection, etc., all of which can prove unreliable.",

    "question": "Have you ever worked with retina graphics? If so, when and what techniques did you use?",
    "answer": "_Retina_ is just a marketing term to refer to high resolution screens with a pixel ratio bigger than 1. The key thing to know is that using a pixel ratio means these displays are emulating a lower resolution screen in order to show elements with the same size. Nowadays we consider all mobile devices _retina_ defacto displays.\n\nBrowsers by default render DOM elements according to the device resolution, except for images.\n\nIn order to have crisp, good-looking graphics that make the best of retina displays we need to use high resolution images whenever possible. However using always the highest resolution images will have an impact on performance as more bytes will need to be sent over the wire.\n\nTo overcome this problem, we can use responsive images, as specified in HTML5. It requires making available different resolution files of the same image to the browser and let it decide which image is best, using the html attribute `srcset` and optionally `sizes`, for instance:\n\n```html\n<div responsive-background-image>\n  <img\n    src=\"/images/test-1600.jpg\"\n    sizes=\"\n      (min-width: 768px) 50vw,\n      (min-width: 1024px) 66vw,\n      100vw\"\n    srcset=\"\n      /images/test-400.jpg   400w,\n      /images/test-800.jpg   800w,\n      /images/test-1200.jpg 1200w\n    \" />\n</div>\n```\n\nIt is important to note that browsers which don't support HTML5's `srcset` (i.e. IE11) will ignore it and use `src` instead. If we really need to support IE11 and we want to provide this feature for performance reasons, we can use a JavaScript polyfill, e.g. Picturefill (link in the references).\n\nFor icons, I would also opt to use SVGs and icon fonts where possible, as they render very crisply regardless of resolution.",

    "question": "Is there any reason you'd want to use `translate()` instead of `absolute` positioning, or vice-versa? And why?",
    "answer": "`translate()` is a value of CSS `transform`. Changing `transform` or `opacity` does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers `reflow`. `transform` causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence `translate()` is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations.\n\nWhen using `translate()`, the element still occupies its original space (sort of like `position: relative`), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.\n\n#### References\n\n- https://www.paulirish.com/2012/why-moving-elements-with-translate-is-better-than-posabs-topleft/",

You are recommended to spend at least a few minutes clarifying the requirements. Do not start drawing the architecture before you are clear about the requirements!\n\nThankfully, components have well-defined scope and not try to do too many things.

    "question": "Data model",
    "answer": "Data model for components will refer to the component state. The concept of state should be familiar to most front end developers who have used front end UI libraries/frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc. In every of these libraries/frameworks, state is a common concept.\n\nDeciding what data to put in state is essential to doing well for this portion. Few factors to consider when deciding what goes into component state:\n\n- State is allowed to change over time during the lifecycle of the component, typically as a result of user interactions.\n- Each component should maintain its own independent state which allows **multiple instances** of the component to coexist on a single page. The state of a component instance should not affect the state of another instance.\n- Components are easier to reason about (read/understand) the fewer the fields there are in the state. We should strive to reduce the amount of state needed. If a component uses a value which can be derived from another piece of state, then that value should most likely not be part of the state. For example if your component is rendering a list of items and you want to display a message when there are no items to render, there shouldn't be an additional `isEmpty` state because it can be derived from the length of the `items`.\n- If a component has multiple subcomponents, it'll be best if it's possible to consolidate the state within the top level and the rest of the components are pure and stateless.",

    "question": "Interface definition (API)",
    "answer": "The key idea behind components is for them to be reused and abstract complexities. Good components are designed in a way that they can be reused in multiple scenarios, and users do not have to know how they work internally before using them. In the case of components, API refers to configuration options that the component developer would expose to other developers for specification.\n\n- What are the configuration options you would allow for the component? (`props` in React). What would be reasonable defaults?\n- Follow the [Open-closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) - the component should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n- If your component is meant to be part of a UI library that doesn't bother about the appearance and leaves the styling to the user, extra care has to go into the design of the props and to allow users to customize the look and feel of the components. There are a few ways to go about this in React:\n  - [Composition](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/component-composition-is-great-btw) - Props which accept React components which also promotes code reuse.\n  - [Render props](https://www.patterns.dev/react/render-props-pattern/) are function props that a component uses to know what to render. It also helps in reusing behavior without bothering about the appearance.\n  - `className` or `style` props - Allows users to inject class names and/or styling attributes to inner DOM elements. This could have negative consequences but is still a common way of allowing user to customize component appearance.\n- Possible configuration options:\n  - Lifecycle/event hooks - `onClick`, `onChange`, `onBlur`, `onFocus`, etc.",

    "question": "Optimization and deep dives",
    "answer": "With the basics of the component covered, we can now delve into specific areas that may require special attention. It is important to note that due to time constraints, it may not be possible to cover every area, and not all areas may be highly relevant to the specific component at hand.\n\nShowing knowledge about these areas and being able to dive deep into them are traits of senior front end engineers.\n\n#### User experience (UX)\n\nUX might not fall squarely under engineering but good front end engineers have good understanding of UX and building UI with great UX. There are too many UX practices to be aware of, but the most common ones/low hanging fruits are:\n\n- Reflect state of the component to the user - If there's a pending background request, show a spinner. If there's an error, make sure to display it instead of silently failing.\n- Display an empty state if there are no items in a list, instead of not rendering anything.\n- Destructive actions should have a confirmation step, especially irreversible ones.\n- Disable interactive elements if they trigger an async request! Prevents double firing of events in the case of accidental double clicking (possible for people with motor disabilities).\n- If there are search inputs involved, each keystroke should not fire a network request.\n- Handle extreme cases\n  - Strings can be really long/short and your UI should not look weird in either case. For long strings, they can have their contents truncated and hidden behind a \"View more\" button.\n  - If there are many items to display within a component, they shouldn't all be displayed on the screen at once and making the page extremely long/wide. Paginate the items or contain them within a container with a maximum width/height.\n- Keyboard friendliness - This involves making sure the component is keyboard-friendly\n  - Add shortcuts to make the component more usable by keyboard-only users\n  - Ensure that elements can be focused and tab order within the component is correct\n- Accessibility is part of UX but will be covered in a later section\n\n#### Performance\n\nIn front end, performance typically refers to a few things - loading speed, how fast the UI responds to user interactions, memory space (heap) required by the component.\n\n- **Loading speed**: The less JavaScript the component contains, the less JavaScript the browser has to download to load the component and the lower the network request time. It's also important to modularize components and allow users to download only the necessary JavaScript modules needed for their use case.\n- **Responsiveness to user interactions**\n  - If a user interaction results in displaying of data that has to be loaded over the network, there will be a delay between the user interaction and updating of the UI. Minimizing that delay or removing it entirely is the key to improving responsiveness.\n  - JavaScript in a browser is single-threaded. The browser can only do execute one line of code at any one time. The less work (JavaScript executed, DOM updates) the component has to do when a user does something on the page, the faster the component can update the UI to respond to the changes.\n- **Memory space**: The more memory your component takes up on the page, the slower the browser performs and the experience will feel sluggish/janky. If your component has to render hundreds/thousands of items (e.g. number of images in a carousel, number of items in a selector), memory space might become significant.\n\n**Optimization tips**\n\n- **Render only what is displayed on the screen**: For example, in a selector, only a few items are displayed to the user even if the list can contain hundreds of elements. Rendering all of them into the browser would be a waste of processing power and memory space. We can leverage a technique called windowing/virtualization to emulate a list with many elements while only rendering a few as possible to make the final result look as if there was no optimization done (especially preserving scroll height). Read more about virtualization [here](https://web.dev/articles/virtualize-long-lists-react-window).\n- **Lazy loading/load only necessary data**: For example, in a photo gallery component, a user can have hundreds and thousands of photos, but it won't be feasible to load all of them eagerly. Most likely the user won't be browsing all of them in that session too. An optimization could be to load only the ones that the user is likely to view, or those that are within the viewport (which we call \"above the fold\"). The rest of the photos can be loaded on demand, which introduces responsiveness delay, but the next tip will help you to handle that.\n- **Preloading/prefetching data ahead of time**: For example, in an image carousel where there are too many images to load beforehand, an optimization could be to load the next image ahead of time while the user is still on the current image, such that when the user clicks the \"Next\" button, there's no network delay needed because the next image has already been loaded. This technique can also be modified to load the next N images to handle the case where users click \"Next\" in rapid succession.\n\n#### Accessibility (a11y)\n\nAccessibility (a11y) is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.\n\n- Color contrasts (e.g. color blindness)\n- Keyboard friendliness (e.g. people with limited fine motor control)\n- Visual Impairment (e.g. blind)\n- Transcripts for audio (e.g. deaf)\n\nNot everyone surfs the web the same way; some people use screenreaders and keyboards exclusively (no mouse)! Here are some basic tips for achieving a11y in UI components:\n\n- Foreground colors should have sufficient contrast from the background colors\n- Use the right HTML tags for semanticness, or the right `aria-role` attributes\n- Clickable items should have `tabindex` attribute (so that they are focusable) and also \"cursor: pointer\" styling to indicate that they can be clicked on\n- Images should have `alt` text, which will be read out by screen readers and act as a fallback description if the image fails to load\n- `aria-label`s help to provide context to elements which are non-obvious to non-visual users. E.g. an icon button without any text label within it should have an `aria-label` attribute so that the intention is clear for users who can't see the icon\n\na11y is one of the most commonly neglected areas as most of the time they're invisible to the developer. Showing knowledge of a11y and possessing the skills to create accessible components will definitely reflect well on you. More reading on [Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/).\n\n#### Internationalization (i18n)\n\nInternationalization (i18n) is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language. Typically components shouldn't have to worry about i18n unless under few specific circumstances:\n\n- **Component uses strings**: Strings used in the component shouldn't be hardcoded to a specific language (e.g. \"Prev\"/\"Next\" in the controls of a photo gallery component). The strings can be specified as a prop with the English version as default\n- **Order of content matters**: Does your component support RTL (right to left) languages like Arabic and Hebrew?\n\n#### Multi-device support\n\nIs the component expected to be used on mobile web? Mobile devices have unique constraints - they have less powerful hardware and viewport size is smaller. Hence things could be done differently to allow the component to work better on mobile devices - making a conscious effort to:\n\n- Not use too much memory - using too much memory makes the device perform slower\n- Increasing the hit box of interactive elements - fingers have an easier time tapping on the right element\n\n#### Security\n\nMost of the time, components aren't exposed to security vulnerabilities, but it can still happen. Here are the more common security vulnerabilities you should be aware of:\n\n- XSS - Is your component vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS)? E.g. Do you render user input via `.innerHTML` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React-specific)?\n- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)\n- Clickjacking\n- [`rel=noopener`](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/)",

    "answer": "- The assumption is that a group of weak learners can be combined to form a strong learner.\n- Hence the combined model is expected to perform better than an individual model.\n- Assumptions:\n- average out biases\n- reduce variance\n- Bagging works because some underlying learning algorithms are unstable: slightly different inputs leads to very different outputs. If you can take advantage of this instability by running multiple instances, it can be shown that the reduced instability leads to lower error. If you want to understand why, the original bagging paper( [http://www.springerlink.com/cont...](http://www.springerlink.com/content/l4780124w2874025/)) has a section called \"why bagging works\"\n- Boosting works because of the focus on better defining the \"decision edge\". By reweighting examples near the margin (the positive and negative examples) you get a reduced error (see http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/vie...)\n- Use the outputs of your models as inputs to a meta-model.\nFor example, if you're doing binary classification, you can use all the probability outputs of your individual models as inputs to a final logistic regression (or any model, really) that can combine the probability estimates.\nOne very important point is to make sure that the output of your models are out-of-sample predictions.

(covariate shift)\n- P(y|x) are different. (concept shift)\n- The causes can be:\n- Training samples are obtained in a biased way.
